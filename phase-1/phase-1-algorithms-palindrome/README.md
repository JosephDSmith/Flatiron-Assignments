# Palindrome Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice algorithmic problem solving

## Introduction

Now that we've discussed what an algorithm is and defined a problem-solving
approach, it's time to apply that to your first algorithm problem! Fork and
clone this lab, then **read the instructions before running any tests**.

## Instructions

Write a function `isPalindrome` that will receive one argument, a string. Your
function should return `true` if the string is a palindrome (that is, if it
reads the same forwards and backwards, like `"mom"` or `"racecar"`), and return
`false` if it is not a palindrome.

To keep things simple, your function only needs to deal with lowercase strings
that are all letters (don't worry about spaces or special characters).

Here are a few examples:

```txt
Input: "madam"
Output: true

Input: "robot"
Output: false
```

## Problem Solving Approach

Use the
[problem solving process](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-algorithms-what-is-an-algorithm)
described in the previous lesson to come up with an approach to the problem and
write your solution:

1. Rewrite the Problem in Your Own Words
2. Write Your Own Test Cases
3. Pseudocode
4. Code
5. Make It Clean and Readable
6. Optimize

Code your solution in the `index.js` file. There's space in the `index.js` file
to write your pseudocode, but you're welcome to write pseudocode with pen and
paper if you find that more beneficial.

You should also write some additional test cases in the `index.js` file to check
your solution. After writing your test cases and coding your solution, you can
view the output of your tests by running `node index.js` in the terminal.

For this exercise, you can use Google to look up syntax and any methods you
might need to help solve this problem (note that not all interviewers will allow
candidates to look up syntax, but some will).

When you're satisfied with your code, run `npm test` to run the tests and
submit the lab using CodeGrade.

## Conclusion

In the next two lessons, we'll review some solutions to this problem and talk
through how to apply the problem solving process to this exercise. Take your
time with this, and give it your best effort before reviewing the solution â€”
it's ok if you don't end up with a working solution on the first try, so long as
you make a deliberate effort at developing your problem solving process!
